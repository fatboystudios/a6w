                        <p>At least a few times in your life, you've likely dreamed about attracting a gorgeous member
                            of the opposite sex with your perfectly toned abs. Perhaps you think you'll feel much better
                            about yourself if you see a toned stomach in the mirror every morning. Alternatively, maybe
                            too many years of consuming unheathy food and drinks has simply made your stomach too fat,
                            and you want to fix that.
                            In the world of athletics, there are many different training programs which involve
                            exercises
                            that will allow you to develop the toned stomach muscles you've always dreamed of. One of
                            these is the Aerobic Six Pack Workout training program, which is known by many people worldwide, including people who only have limited knowledge of exercise programs.

                        <p>At this point, you're
                            probably wondering why it is so legendary and commonly known. This is because it has been
                            such a successful training program for many professional athletes and ordinary people. Some
                            people are unable to complete the exercises, but those who have survived the training
                            program are now the envy of others at their gyms, due to their astonishingly strong, hard,
                            and flat stomachs. So, how does this "magic" training work? It is based on six easy
                            exercises completed one after another. If you perform these exercises with maximum effort
                            and efficiency, while following a nutritious diet program, your stomach muscles will become
                            larger, harder, and more durable.</p>

                            training system. Every element of the program will be described in detail, so that you are
                            able to avoid common problems and issues people have when they do not complete the exercises
                            in a proper manner. Amateur athletes often do not realize the supreme necessity of using a
                            flat surface to complete these exercises. Using a surface which is not completely flat will
                            put your back in an incorrect position, which will decrease the effectiveness of the
                            exercises to almost zero.</p>

                        <p class="">This Training has been prepared two different training schedules, based on the preferences
                            of the
                            individuals using the A6W exercises. One schedule is meant for serious athletes and
                            other people who exercise frequently. It involves training seven days per week, with no
                            muscle
                            relaxation and recovery period, and will allow you to complete the program in 42 days
                            (therefore,
                            it is also known as A6W 42). The other schedule is meant for ordinary people, and will allow
                            you
                            to complete the program within 48 days. It involves six days per week of training, and one
                            day
                            per week for full muscle recovery.</p>

                            time to learn
                            exactly what "series" and "repetitions" are. The "series" is the amount of repetitions of a
                            particular exercise done during a set (for example, Series 6 for Exercise 3 means that the
                            third
                            exercise must be performed six times from start to finish). The repetition value indicates
                            how
                            many times the whole set of six exercises must be done within a given day (for example, two
                            repetitions means that the whole set must be performed twice in a day).</p>

                            Trainers recommend that you follow a particular variation of cycles and repetitions when
                            performing the Aerobic Six Pack Workout exercises. According to this variation, every exercise should be
                            done according to the number of series required on a given day. Only proceed to the next
                            exercise after completing the designated number of repetitions within a series. Therefore,
                            your
                            training should look as described below:</p>

                            <li>Exercise 3 performed four times for each leg.</li>

                            complicated quite quickly, so they can also serve as a challenge for advanced athletes. It
                            is easy to find a place to do the exercises; all you need is a flat surface. It provides
                            excellent results—if you want to obtain a flat stomach fairly quickly, W6 is perfect for
                            you. You will see some results after only a week of completing the exercises, and after you
                            complete a whole series, you will be very impressed with your new and improved

                        <p class="lead">The Aerobic Six Pack Workout training program is not only for body builders and professional
                            athletes. The level of muscle stimulation offered by the exercises can be adjusted for every
                            group of people doing them, including beginner and intermediate athletes.

                            The first few days of training involve simple and undemanding sets, so even a beginner
                            athlete is able to develop some strength in their abdominals. Every day, the level of
                            difficulty gradually increases, as the number of repetitions required is gradually raised.
                            The aim of this gradual increase in difficulty is to cause fastpaced muscle development by
                            fully exhausting your stomach muscles' tissues. If beginners find they are unable to
                            increase

                            repetitions within a set for a few days, until they reach an adequate level of muscle
                            adaptation, and then increase the number of repetitions. However, this is not recommended.
                            If you do this, you will not see results from the training program as quickly as is usual,
                            as this strategy will decrease the total level of effort made by your stomach muscles over
                            the course of the program. To avoid having to do this, you should develop a basic level of
                            abdominal strength before beginning the Weider's Six training program. In order to build up
                            an adequate foundation, you should be able to do 200 situps per day before starting.</p>

                        <p class="lead">The Aerobic Six Pack Workout training program makes it possible to stimulate your abdominal
                            muscles and burn excess fat at the same time. Therefore, after you complete the program, you
                            will not only have firm, shapely abdominal muscles, but will also have a goodlooking,
                            wellbuilt overall body shape. The optimum time to take to do each repetition of a set of
                            exercises is 30-40 minutes, as fat burning starts after 30 to 40 minutes of constant
                            training. It is possible to lose a few kg during the first two to three weeks of the
                            program, which is 42 to 48 days long in total.</p>

                        <p class="lead">You must remember to stick to a nutritional diet, and keep taking the
                            nutritional and musclebuilding supplements you normally take, or the whole training process
                            will work less efficiently. Your health is more important than anything else—do not train
                            directly after eating, and always take a break if you feel you're overexerting yourself.</p>

                            highlight the lack of side effects involved with this particular training program. The
                            exercises within the Aerobic Six Pack Workout method will not lead to excessive back pain or excessive
                            pressure on your hips or neck. Doctors consider the program a good form of rehabilitation
                            for athletes who are injured, and people who have been out of shape for long periods of
                            time.</p>

                        <p class="lead">If you have developed self discipline
                            and strong stomach muscles in 42 or 48 days, you have
                            successfully completed the Weider's Six training program. If you have followed the program's
                            rules properly, the effects on your abdominals should be clearly visible. You're probably
                            wondering, "What do I do now?" The answer to this question depends on your own individual
                            preferences. Most people who are not professional athletes, and/or do not exercise
                            frequently
                            will often stop doing abdominal exercises at this point, as they can be demanding and
                            painful,
                            especially when you have to do them six or seven days per week.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="span4">
                    <div class="box-dark">

                        <p class="lead">If you are in pain, you should
                            take a short break, as you are supposed to take pleasure from exercising instead of finding
                            it a
                            torment. However, after you've made this much progress regarding the improvement of both the
                            appearance and strength of your abdominal muscles, do not quit exercising completely. Take a
                            week to a month to recover from this difficult period of exercise and restore your
                            motivation if you
                            need to, then start stimulating your stomach muscles again in order to avoid unwanted fat
                            gains. If you want to maintain the fitness level you gained through your completion of the
                            Weider's Six training program, trainers believe that you should continue to train two to
                            three times per week, performing ten to twelve repetitions of each exercise. </p>

                    <div class="box-dark">

                        <p class="lead">Complete an entire series three times per day. If, by chance, your stomach
                            muscles have not become quite strong enough, even after 42 to 48
                            days of the Weider's Six training program, you must also keep performing the exercises
                            regularly, while adjusting the amount of daily repetitions in order to achieve your desired
                            results.
                            Experts suggest that you add one additional repetition of a set per day. At this point, your
                            stomach muscles should be strong enough to handle the additional pressure of this extra
                            repetition.</p>
